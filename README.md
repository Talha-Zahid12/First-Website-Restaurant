# Savour-Foods Clone <br>
This is my First ever website after learning basics of HTML, CSS and Java Script. I have collaborated with my friend to make this website. Most of the designing part (HTML, CSS) is done by me whereas Javascript is mostly written by my fellow. The clone doesn't exactly match the orignal website but still it is good as it is my first try. Will keep Improving it time to time.
