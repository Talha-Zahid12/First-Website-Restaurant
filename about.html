        Savour Foods is a popular name among pulao enthusiasts, as the restaurant has been deemed one of the best places
        for this particular dish in the country.
        It has been serving its customers for over a decade and is now considered a go-to spot for authentic Pakistani
        food in Lahore.
        Savour Foods has branches in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Lahore and is known for its generous portions and
        affordable prices.
        Savour Foods Lahore is often misspelled as “Saver Foods Lahore.” Remember, the correct spelling is Savour Foods
        Lahore.
        It was founded in 1980 by Muhammad Naeem Butt, who started with a small stall in Rawalpindi.Since then, it has
        become one of the most popular and successful food businesses in Pakistan,
        with branches in Islamabad, Karachi, Peshawar, and Lahore.The main reason why Savour Foods Lahore is a
        must-visit for food lovers is the authentic taste. The pulao is perfectly cooked with tender and juicy meat and
        fragrant rice. The shami kebabs are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a hint of spice and
        herbs.
        The salad is fresh and crunchy, and the raita adds a refreshing touch. The portions are generous and filling,
        and the service is fast and friendly.
        The restaurant is always bustling with customers of all ages and backgrounds, from families and friends to
        students and professionals. You can feel the energy and excitement of the people as they enjoy their food and
        chat with each other. The restaurant also has a TV screen that shows live cricket matches or news updates,
        adding to the entertainment factor.
        The service is fast and efficient. You have to place your order at the counter and wait for your number to be
        called. You can also order online or by phone, and they offer delivery and catering services.
        The only downside of Savour Food is that it can get very crowded and noisy at peak hours, especially on
        weekends. You might have to wait for a long time to get your order or find a seat.
